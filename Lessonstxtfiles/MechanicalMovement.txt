The movement is one of the main features of the materia. The simplest of the matter movement is the mechanical movement. The Earth is changing its position over the Sun. Man changes his position over the Earth. Many other examples of this and similar patterns show that "bodies can change their position over other bodies over time."
Consider another example. Man walking on the spot. In this case, the position of the human hands and feet changes to his back. The second important argument, "positions on one another may also change parts of the body."
From this we get the definition of mechanical movement. Mechanical movement is called a change of body position in space over time, changing the positions of other parts or parts of the body toward one another. The section of physics that explores the mechanical movement of bodies is called mechanics. The main problem of mechanics is "to determine the position of the body in space at the time of the arbitrary moment".
